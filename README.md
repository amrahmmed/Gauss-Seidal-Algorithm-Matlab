# Gauss-Seidal-Algorithm-Matlab
A MATLAB script that performs numerical integration using Romberg’s method. The code builds trapezoidal approximations, applies Richardson extrapolation to construct the full Romberg table, computes the final high-accuracy estimate, and visualizes convergence toward the exact analytical solution.
